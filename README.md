# HR Promotion Classification 

Given the importance of timely promotions in maintaining organizational efficiency and employee satisfaction, our main business concern is **how the company can streamline the promotion process for managerial positions and below** by identifying eligible candidates at critical checkpoints. This approach will allow the HR team to expedite the entire promotion cycle, ensuring that the right employees are promoted at the right time, and that transitions into new roles are smooth and efficient. 

To achieve this, the company needs to leverage data-driven insights from historical performance evaluations, employee feedback, and other relevant metrics. The goal is to create a predictive model that can identify potential candidates who are ready for promotion, allowing the HR team to proactively prepare them for their new roles. This will not only reduce delays in the promotion process but also enhance employee engagement and retention by providing clear and timely career advancement opportunities. The **main stakeholder of this project will be the HR team, particularly the HR managers responsible for overseeing promotions** across the various verticals within the organization.
